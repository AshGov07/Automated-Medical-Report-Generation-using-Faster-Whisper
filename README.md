## üöÄ Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Run the Python script to open the GUI interface
   - The application will create a default save directory at `~/Desktop/wav files`

2. **Set Up Physician Information**
   - Enter the physician's name in the top field
   - Click "Update" to save to the document

3. **Begin Recording**
   - Select a report section from the left panel, or
   - Use voice command: "Go to [section name]"
   - Click "Start Recording" to begin transcription

### Voice Commands

The system recognizes various command patterns to navigate between sections:

```
"go to patient information"
"goto gestational age"  
"go to fetal heart rate"
```

**Supported Command Variations:**
- `go to [section]`
- `goto [section]`
- `go do [section]`
- `go 2 [section]`

### Workflow Example

1. Start the application
2. Say: "Go to patient information"
3. Dictate: "Patient is a 28-year-old female, gravida 2, para 1"
4. Say: "Go to gestational age"  
5. Dictate: "Based on LMP, gestational age is 8 weeks 3 days"
6. Continue through all sections...
